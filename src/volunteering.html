            <p>ZhasUlan and Astana Zhastary Volunteering Organizations</p>
            <p>For three years, I have been an active volunteer with ZhasUlan and Astana Zhastary, two of Kazakhstan's leading volunteer organizations. Through these organizations, I've had the opportunity to contribute to various community projects, including helping families in need and supporting sick children. These experiences have taught me the importance of giving back to the community and making a difference in people's lives.</p>
